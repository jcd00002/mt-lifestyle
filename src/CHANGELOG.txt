ChangeLog Bonus Lab 

The first thing I did in this lab was run the command ng test which opened up the a link 
in google chrome that ran tests in the app.component.spec.ts 

-- removed the test that was throwing the error just link in Nikola's video

//Creation of new file called gt500-cards.component.spec.ts 
Inside of the file, we copied the components from angular to have a foundation of unit tests 

// this file runs tests to see if the cards we are creating are operating like they should 
// the cards were created using a ngFor loop 

// creation of a test to see if the component is actually created, which is successful 
// addition of a new test to check if the description of the card that is expected is returning the correct value 
// addition of a new test to check if the expected card price is displayed like it should
