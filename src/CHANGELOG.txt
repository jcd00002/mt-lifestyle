To begin working this week on the website, the first order of instructions was to install routing for angular.

Ater I installed routing for angular, the app-routing.module.ts appear in the package explorer. 

1.Inside of route module, implementation of a new linked list takes places. 
Next I imported the routerModules from angular. 

2.To create new components and make code aviable on certain pages on compared to others, I began making a series of classes and moving some code around. 
+ Addition of files called mustang.merch-layout.component.css,html,ts
+ implementation of the ts file that way it is able to be used on the website
+ imported in the app.module.ts file 
+ insde of the app-routing class, addition of path to the webpage for the tab "Mustang Lifestyle Merch" 

Inside of the class of second.top navbar component.html:
+ addition of routerLink to the Mustang Lifestyle Merch implmentation button. 

Creation of another routing/ new component file called homelayout.component
+ This file takes place as the new homepage where all the code, cards, navbar, carousel were created
+ Luckly all of these components belong inside the home tab, therefore I moved the code for everything from app.module.html besides the navbar
inside of homelayout.component.html

3. Addition of new files called "ford-vehicles-layout.component.css,html,ts 
+ implementation of the ts file that way it is able to be used on the website
+ imported in the app.module.ts file 
+ insde of the app-routing class, addition of path to the webpage for the tab "Ford Vehicles" 

4. Addition of new angular routing/component files called "Account" to take you to the account page 
+ implementation of the ts file that way it is able to be used on the website
+ imported in the app.module.ts file 
+ insde of the app-routing class, addition of path to the webpage for the tab "mustanglifestyle.net/account" 

5.  Addition of new angular routing/component files called "2020-gt500.component.css,html,ts" to take you to the account page 
+ implementation of the ts file that way it is able to be used on the website
+ imported in the app.module.ts file 
+ insde of the app-routing class, addition of path to the webpage for imformation about the "2020 gt500" 

6. After created the 5 components then adding routes to them I began to fix some issues I am having on my "home" page
